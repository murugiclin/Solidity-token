🪙 MyToken: A Fully Upgradeable, Feature-Rich ERC20 Token
🔐 Access-Controlled · 💳 ERC1363 Payable · 🧠 Vote-Enabled · 🔄 UUPS Upgradeable
📜 Description

MyToken is a highly modular, ERC20-compatible smart contract built using OpenZeppelin's upgradeable libraries. It integrates a comprehensive set of features such as:

    🔐 Role-based access control

    ⏸️ Pausable transfers

    🔥 Burnable tokens

    🏦 Flash minting

    📄 Permit-based approvals (EIP-2612)

    🗳️ On-chain governance voting (ERC20Votes)

    💳 ERC1363 (Payable ERC20 standard)

    🧬 Upgradeable via UUPS proxy pattern

The contract is designed for real-world production use, enabling extensibility, governance, DeFi interactions, and forward-compatibility.
🧩 Inherited Modules
Module	Description
ERC20Upgradeable	Standard fungible token implementation
ERC20BurnableUpgradeable	Allows token holders to burn (destroy) their tokens
ERC20PausableUpgradeable	Allows authorized accounts to pause all token transfers
AccessControlUpgradeable	Role-based access system for secure permissions
ERC1363Upgradeable	Enables transfer-and-call and approval-and-call patterns
ERC20PermitUpgradeable	Adds EIP-2612 support for gasless approvals
ERC20VotesUpgradeable	Supports governance voting with snapshots
ERC20FlashMintUpgradeable	Supports flash minting (mint & burn in same tx)
UUPSUpgradeable	Allows UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard) upgrades
Initializable	Manages upgrade-safe initial setup
NoncesUpgradeable	Tracks nonces for permit and replay protection
🔐 Role Definitions
Role Constant	Purpose
DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE	Master control over all roles
PAUSER_ROLE	Authorized to pause/unpause transfers
MINTER_ROLE	Authorized to mint new tokens
UPGRADER_ROLE	Authorized to upgrade the implementation contract
🚀 Initialization

function initialize(
    address defaultAdmin,
    address pauser,
    address minter,
    address upgrader
)

Called once after deployment (via proxy) to initialize all inherited contracts and assign roles.
🔧 Core Functions
🛑 Pause / Unpause

function pause() public onlyRole(PAUSER_ROLE)
function unpause() public onlyRole(PAUSER_ROLE)

Temporarily halts all transfers.
🪙 Minting

function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE)

Creates new tokens and assigns them to the specified address.
🔄 Upgrade Authorization

function _authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation)
    internal
    override
    onlyRole(UPGRADER_ROLE)

Restricts upgrades to accounts with the UPGRADER_ROLE.
🔄 Overridden Functions
Function	Reason for Override
_update	Ensure transfer hooks work with Votes and Pausable logic
supportsInterface	Ensure proper ERC1363 and AccessControl interface detection
nonces	Resolve multiple inheritance conflict with NoncesUpgradeable and Permit
🧪 Example Deployment (Hardhat)

const factory = await ethers.getContractFactory("MyToken");
const token = await upgrades.deployProxy(factory, [admin, pauser, minter, upgrader], {
  initializer: "initialize"
});

📚 Requirements

    Solidity ≥0.8.27

    OpenZeppelin Contracts Upgradeable v5.x

⚠️ Security Considerations

    Ensure role management is secure (e.g., multisig for UPGRADER_ROLE).

    Pausable feature should be tested for emergency response.

    Flash minting can be exploited if not handled carefully in downstream contracts.

    Votes module assumes snapshot integrity; verify before governance use.
